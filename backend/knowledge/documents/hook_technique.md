# Krav Maga Hook Punch Technique

## Stance Adjustments and Weight Distribution

The hook punch in Krav Maga requires specific stance adjustments that differ from the jab and cross. For the lead hook, body weight shifts slightly toward the lead leg — moving from the neutral 50/50 distribution to approximately 55-60% on the lead foot. This forward weight loading is necessary because the lead hook generates power through rotational torque centered on the lead leg rather than through linear forward drive. The rear hook involves the opposite shift, with weight initially loaded on the rear leg before transferring forward through the rotation. In both cases, the knees remain slightly bent throughout the strike to maintain a low, stable center of gravity and to allow the legs to contribute to the rotational power. The fighting stance narrows very slightly compared to straight punches — the feet move approximately 2-5 centimeters closer together laterally to facilitate pivoting. However, the stance should never become so narrow that balance is compromised. The fighter must be able to absorb a push or pull from any direction during and after the hook without stumbling. Coaching cue: "Load the spring on your lead leg — your weight sits on that front foot like a coiled spring ready to unwind." For the rear hook, the same principle applies to the rear leg: "Sit into your back hip, then let it explode through."

## Arm Angle and Fist Orientation

The defining characteristic of the hook is the approximately 90-degree bend at the elbow, maintained throughout the strike. The forearm and upper arm form a rigid L-shape, with the elbow held at shoulder height and the fist traveling on a horizontal arc parallel to the ground. This 90-degree angle is critical — if the angle opens beyond 100-110 degrees, the strike degrades into a wide, looping swing that sacrifices speed, power, and structural integrity. If the angle closes below 80 degrees, range is lost and the strike becomes a cramped, ineffective movement. The arm acts as a single rigid unit from shoulder to fist — there is no independent movement of the forearm or wrist during the strike. The fist orientation at impact can follow two schools: the traditional horizontal fist (palm facing down, knuckles horizontal) or the thumb-up vertical fist (palm facing inward, thumb pointing toward the ceiling). In Krav Maga, the thumb-up orientation is generally preferred for the lead hook because it maintains a more natural wrist alignment that reduces the risk of wrist injury on impact, and it keeps the elbow in a structurally stronger position. The horizontal fist is more common for the rear hook thrown at longer range. Contact is made with the first two knuckles (index and middle finger), and the wrist must remain rigidly straight regardless of fist orientation. Coaching cue: "Lock that 90-degree angle and forget about it — your arm is an iron bar bent at the elbow. The angle never changes from start to finish."

## Hip Rotation and Power Generation

The hook derives the vast majority of its power — approximately 40-50% of total strike force — from explosive hip rotation. For the lead hook, power generation begins from the ground: the lead foot pivots on the ball of the foot (metatarsal heads), rotating the heel outward approximately 45-90 degrees. This foot pivot drives the lead hip through a powerful rotation of 45-60 degrees toward the target. The torso follows the hip as a connected unit, and the arm — locked at its 90-degree angle — is carried through the arc by the body's rotation rather than by independent arm movement. The arm does not swing on its own; it rides the wave of the body's rotational force. For the rear hook, the mechanics mirror on the opposite side: the rear foot pivots, the rear hip drives forward and through, and the torso rotates to carry the locked arm into the target. The rear hook generates slightly more power than the lead hook because the rotation travels through a larger arc (the rear side has farther to travel to reach the target). The core muscles — obliques, transverse abdominis, and serratus anterior — function as the critical force-transfer bridge between the lower body rotation and the striking arm. Without engaged core muscles, the rotational force dissipates at the waist and never reaches the fist. Coaching cue: "Your hip throws the hook — the arm is just along for the ride. If your hip doesn't move, your hook has no power."

## Elbow Position and Arc of Travel

The elbow must remain at shoulder height throughout the entire arc of the hook — from initiation to impact to retraction. Dropping the elbow below shoulder height is one of the most common and damaging errors, as it converts the horizontal hook into a looping uppercut hybrid that lacks the structural integrity of either strike. The elbow leads the movement — it drives forward and around the arc, with the fist trailing slightly behind. The arc of the hook is deliberately short and tight, traveling approximately 90-120 degrees of rotation rather than a full 180-degree windmill swing. The fist begins at the guard position next to the cheekbone and travels along a compact horizontal arc to the target, which is typically the opponent's jaw, temple, or the side of the chin. The short arc is critical for two reasons: speed (a shorter arc means less distance to cover, meaning faster delivery) and concealment (a tight hook is much harder for the opponent to see coming than a wide, sweeping swing). The strike should feel like a door closing — the body is the hinge, the arm is the door, and the fist is the edge of the door that makes contact. At no point should the arm extend outward away from the body to create a wider arc; the power comes from body rotation, not from arm reach. Coaching cue: "Short and sharp — your fist takes the inside lane, not the scenic route. Elbow stays at shoulder height like it's riding a rail."

## Guard Maintenance and Defensive Responsibility

The non-punching hand must remain firmly in guard position throughout the hook — pressed against the opposite cheekbone with the elbow tucked against the ribs. This is particularly critical during the hook because the body's rotation naturally wants to pull both arms in the direction of the turn, creating a strong sympathetic tendency for the guard hand to drift away from the face. For the lead hook, the rear hand must stay glued to the right cheekbone (for an orthodox fighter), protecting against counter-crosses and overhands that the opponent may throw simultaneously. For the rear hook, the lead hand must remain at the left cheekbone, protecting against counter-jabs and lead hooks. The chin tucks behind the shoulder of the punching arm during the hook — for the lead hook, the chin drops behind the lead shoulder; for the rear hook, behind the rear shoulder as it drives forward. This shoulder-chin connection provides a natural protective barrier against counter-punches landing on the jaw. The shoulder of the punching arm naturally rises during the rotation if the mechanics are correct, creating additional coverage. Dropping the guard hand during a hook is especially dangerous because the rotational commitment of the hook makes it difficult to recover quickly if a counter-punch lands. Coaching cue: "Your free hand is superglued to your cheekbone — the other hand throws the hook, but this hand has one job: protect your face. Don't let it wander."

## Common Errors and Corrections

The most prevalent error is throwing the hook with the arm too straight — opening the elbow angle well beyond 90 degrees. This transforms the hook into a slapping, arm-only swing that carries minimal force, covers excessive distance (making it slow and visible), and exposes the fighter to counters during the long arc. Correction: practice the hook while lightly touching the bicep to the forearm to maintain the 90-degree angle. The second critical error is dropping the elbow below shoulder height, which creates a looping trajectory that is both less powerful and easier for the opponent to see and defend. Correction: practice hooks in front of a mirror with a focus on keeping the elbow on an imaginary horizontal rail at shoulder height. The third error is winding up — pulling the arm back or dropping the hand before initiating the hook. This telegraphing movement gives the opponent a clear warning that a hook is coming, eliminating the element of surprise that makes the hook effective. The hook must launch directly from the guard position with no preparatory movement. Correction: have a training partner watch for any backward movement of the hand or shoulder before the hook; any telegraph means the repetition does not count. The fourth error is telegraphing with the shoulder — the lead shoulder dips or rotates backward before the hook fires. Correction: the hook initiation should be invisible from the front; the first movement the opponent sees should be the fist arriving at their temple. Coaching cue: "No wind-up, no dip, no tell — the hook starts from guard and the first thing they see is stars."

## Hook Drills and Training Cues Summary

Key coaching cues for developing effective Krav Maga hooks: (1) "Lock the L" — maintain the 90-degree arm angle throughout the entire movement. (2) "Pivot and punch" — emphasizes that the foot pivot initiates the hook, not the arm. (3) "Short arc, big power" — emphasizes the compact trajectory powered by body rotation. (4) "Shoulder to chin" — emphasizes the chin protection behind the punching shoulder. (5) "Free hand stays home" — emphasizes maintaining the non-punching guard hand. Common training drills include: the mirror drill where the fighter throws hooks while watching for any telegraph, wind-up, or elbow drop; the wall drill where the fighter stands with their side 10-15 centimeters from a wall and throws the lead hook without the fist touching the wall behind them (prevents winding up); the partner check drill where the training partner holds a hand against the fighter's guard-side cheekbone and verifies the guard hand never leaves during hook repetitions; the body rotation drill where the fighter practices the pivoting and hip rotation without the arm to isolate and perfect the lower-body mechanics; and the combination drill integrating the hook after a jab-cross sequence to practice the transition from linear to rotational strikes without dropping the guard.
