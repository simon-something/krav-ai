# Krav Maga Jab-Cross Combination

## Combination Overview and Purpose

The jab-cross (also called the "one-two") is the foundational striking combination in Krav Maga and one of the most effective two-punch sequences in all combat systems. The jab serves as the setup strike — it closes distance, occupies the opponent's vision, disrupts their guard, and creates an opening along the centerline. The cross follows immediately with full body power, capitalizing on the opening created by the jab and the opponent's momentary distraction or defensive reaction. In Krav Maga's self-defense context, this combination embodies Imi Lichtenfeld's principle of decisive counterattack — the jab initiates the offensive response, and the cross delivers fight-ending force. The combination is greater than the sum of its parts: the sequential timing creates a one-two rhythm that is significantly harder for an opponent to defend against than either punch thrown in isolation, because they must deal with two threats in rapid succession along the same attack line. The jab also serves a tactical function — it measures distance for the cross, ensuring the power punch lands at optimal range. In training, the jab-cross should be the first combination taught and the most frequently drilled, as it forms the foundation for all longer combinations (jab-cross-hook, jab-cross-jab, etc.).

## Transition Fluidity and Timing

The transition from jab to cross must be seamless — there should be no pause, reset, hitch, or return to neutral between the two strikes. As the jab begins its retraction, the cross is already initiating. This timing overlap is biomechanically efficient: the jab retracting creates a natural counter-rotation of the torso that pre-loads the rear hip for the cross. The lead shoulder pulling back as the jab retracts is the same motion as the rear shoulder driving forward for the cross — they are one continuous movement. This means the jab's retraction energy directly feeds into the cross's initiation, conserving energy and maintaining momentum. The combined movement should feel like one continuous flowing action, not two separate punches with a gap between them. Target timing for trained practitioners: the interval between jab impact and cross impact should be approximately 0.15-0.25 seconds (150-250 milliseconds). If there is a visible pause between strikes, the combination loses its primary advantage — the opponent has time to recover from the jab, reset their guard, or launch a counter between the two punches. The transition should be drilled extensively with a metronome or rhythmic counting (one-TWO, one-TWO) to internalize the timing. Coaching cue: "The jab is the trigger, the cross is the bullet — there is no gap between pulling the trigger and the bullet firing."

## Guard Maintenance During Transition

Guard maintenance during the jab-cross transition is a complex coordination challenge because both hands are in motion at overlapping times during the combination. The sequence of guard responsibility must be understood clearly: (1) During the jab — the rear hand maintains full guard at the cheekbone, providing primary facial protection. The lead hand is out, but the shoulder covers the chin on the lead side. (2) During the transition — as the jab retracts and the cross initiates, there is a brief critical moment where neither hand is at the face. This window must be minimized to an absolute minimum by ensuring the jab retracts explosively fast. The lead hand should be arriving at the cheekbone at approximately the same time the rear hand is departing. (3) During the cross — the lead hand has taken over guard duty at the cheekbone, protecting the face on the lead side, while the rear shoulder covers the chin on the cross side at full extension. At no point should both hands be away from the face simultaneously for more than a fraction of a second. The elbows remain tucked during all transitions, continuing to protect the torso. The chin stays tucked throughout the entire combination — it does not lift between strikes. Coaching cue: "One hand is always home — as one goes out, the other comes back. They pass each other on the way, like a revolving door."

## Stance Recovery Between Strikes

The feet and overall stance should remain stable and grounded throughout the entire jab-cross combination. The jab is thrown without significant stance disruption — the feet stay planted and the weight distribution remains near 50/50 with only subtle forward shift. When the cross fires, the weight shifts forward to approximately 60-70% on the front foot and the rear foot pivots on the ball. After the cross, the stance must recover immediately: weight redistributes back to 50/50, the rear foot pivots back to its starting position, and the bladed body angle re-establishes. The feet should not shuffle, cross, collapse inward, or drift apart during the combination. The front foot acts as an anchor throughout, maintaining its position and providing a stable grounding point. If the stance collapses during the combination — feet drifting too close together, weight too far forward beyond the front foot, or base becoming too narrow — the fighter loses both offensive power (no stable platform to push off) and defensive stability (vulnerable to being pushed off-balance). Common stance errors during the jab-cross include: stepping the rear foot forward during the cross (narrowing the stance), lifting the front foot during the jab (losing the anchor), and failing to return the rear foot to position after the cross pivot. Coaching cue: "Your feet are the foundation — they stay rooted while your hands do the work. Check your feet after every combination."

## Eliminating Telegraphing Between Strikes

Telegraphing between the jab and cross is any movement that signals the upcoming cross before it launches. Common inter-strike telegraphs include: pulling the rear hand backward from the cheekbone before punching forward (loading up), shifting weight noticeably onto the rear foot before driving forward (rocking back), dipping the rear shoulder down before the cross (shoulder telegraph), widening the eyes or tensing the facial muscles, inhaling sharply between strikes, or pausing to "set" the rear foot before pivoting. The jab-cross combination must be thrown from the guard with zero preparatory movement between the strikes. The hands fire from where they are — the jab from the guard, the cross from the guard. There is no intermediate positioning. The key to eliminating telegraphing is relaxation — tension in the shoulders, neck, and arms creates jerky, visible preparatory movements that signal intent. A relaxed fighter has smooth, fast, nearly invisible strike initiation. Drilling is essential: practice in front of a mirror to identify personal telegraph habits, then work with a training partner who is specifically instructed to counter (light tap to the face) any time they detect a telegraph before the cross. Video review of training sessions is particularly effective for identifying telegraphs that the fighter cannot feel themselves doing. Coaching cue: "Don't announce it — just do it. Relax between strikes. No preview, no loading, no windup."

## Maintaining Forward Pressure and Range

The jab-cross combination should maintain or gain ground — the fighter should not retreat, lean backward, or fade away during the combination. The jab may be thrown at the current range or while stepping slightly forward with the lead foot (approximately half a step, 15-20 centimeters) to close distance. If stepping with the jab, the step and the jab land simultaneously — the front foot touches down at the same moment the fist impacts the target. This synchronization of step and punch is critical for maintaining balance and generating power from the new position. The cross then follows at the new, closer range with the full weight of the body behind it. This forward pressure sequence keeps the opponent on the defensive, forces them backward, and does not allow them to set their feet and counter effectively. However, forward pressure must be controlled: over-reaching with the jab (leaning forward beyond the front foot) or lunging with the cross (feet leaving the ground or closing to the same line) extends the fighter beyond their stable base and creates vulnerability to counters and takedowns. The distance between feet — both stance width and stance depth — should remain approximately constant throughout the combination. The fighter moves as a unit, not by reaching with the upper body while the feet lag behind. Coaching cue: "Walk them down — step and punch together, don't reach. Move your whole body forward, not just your arms."

## Rhythm, Cadence, and Breathing

The standard jab-cross has a natural 1-2 rhythm — a lighter, faster jab followed by a heavier, more committed cross. This rhythm should feel natural and relaxed, like a pendulum swinging, and the tempo should become automatic through repetition. Effective fighters vary the timing to remain unpredictable once the basic rhythm is mastered. Common variations include: a fast jab followed immediately by a fast cross (rapid 1-2, used for speed and surprise), a jab with a deliberate micro-pause before a hard cross (broken rhythm to disrupt the opponent's defensive timing), a double jab before the cross (1-1-2, used to create a larger opening), or a light jab followed by an explosive cross (feint-to-power, used to draw a defensive reaction then punish it). In initial training, practitioners should master the standard even rhythm before introducing variations. Breathing must be coordinated with striking: a short, sharp exhale on each strike, typically vocalized as a "tss" or "sh" sound through clenched teeth. This coordinated exhale serves multiple purposes — it engages the core musculature for improved force transfer through the torso, prevents the fighter from having the wind knocked out of them by a body shot that lands during their attack, creates an auditory rhythm that reinforces timing, and prevents breath-holding which causes tension and fatigue. Coaching cue: "Breathe with your punches — sharp exhale on each strike. Tss-TSS, light-HEAVY."

## Common Combination-Specific Errors

Errors specific to the jab-cross combination (distinct from errors in individual strikes) include: (1) Resetting the guard between strikes — bringing both hands back to full guard position before launching the cross. This kills fluidity and creates a visible pause that allows the opponent to reset their defense. The fix: the cross starts as the jab retracts, not after it arrives home. (2) Double-loading — shifting weight backward onto the rear foot between strikes to "power up" the cross. This telegraphs the cross, wastes time, and actually reduces power because it disrupts the continuous forward momentum. The fix: the weight stays forward or neutral; the cross draws power from hip rotation, not from rocking backward. (3) Same-speed, same-power strikes — throwing both the jab and cross at identical speed and commitment. This makes the combination predictable and monotone. The jab should be faster and lighter (approximately 70% effort); the cross should be heavier and fully committed (100% effort). (4) Head staying static on centerline — the head should move very slightly off the centerline during the combination (a subtle slip or head movement), making it harder for opponents to time a counter. (5) Forgetting to recover — throwing the combination and freezing in the final cross position instead of snapping back to guard and neutral stance. Every combination must end with a complete return to fighting stance.
