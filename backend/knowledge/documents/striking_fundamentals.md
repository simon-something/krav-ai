# Krav Maga Striking Fundamentals

## Fighting Stance Width and Foot Placement

The Krav Maga fighting stance begins from a natural standing position. The feet are staggered with the non-dominant foot forward (orthodox: left foot forward; southpaw: right foot forward). Foot placement should be slightly wider than hip width — approximately shoulder-width apart laterally — to create a stable base that resists being pushed or pulled off-balance. The front foot points directly forward toward the opponent while the rear foot is angled slightly outward at approximately 30-45 degrees. The stagger depth (front-to-back distance between feet) should be roughly one shoulder-width, creating a stable rectangular base. All ten toes should maintain ground contact on the front foot, distributing pressure evenly across the ball and heel. This stance differs from a boxing stance in that it is slightly more squared to the opponent, allowing the practitioner to defend against kicks, knees, and grabs in addition to punches. The rectangular footprint provides stability in all four directions: forward pressure for attacks, backward escape, and lateral movement for angling. A stance that is too narrow collapses under lateral pressure; too wide and it sacrifices mobility. Common coaching cues include "stand like you're on railroad tracks" (feet on parallel lines, not on a single tightrope line) and "step, slide, settle" for finding the natural stance width. Practitioners should be able to bounce lightly on the balls of their feet without feeling locked or off-balance.

## Body Angle and Blading

The torso is angled approximately 30-45 degrees relative to the opponent, often described as a "bladed" stance. This blading reduces the target area exposed to the opponent while still allowing full access to both the lead and rear hand for strikes. Krav Maga uses a less extreme blade than traditional boxing — the shoulders remain relatively square compared to a full boxing stance — because the system must account for threats from multiple angles, grabs, and kicks, not just punches. The hips align with the shoulders in the bladed position, creating a unified rotational axis for generating power in both the jab and the cross. A 30-45 degree blade protects the centerline (nose, chin, solar plexus, groin) by turning these targets slightly away from a direct frontal attack. However, excessive blading (beyond 45 degrees) limits the effectiveness of the lead hand, reduces peripheral vision on the rear side, and makes it harder to defend against attacks to the back. The bladed position also pre-loads the rear hip for the cross — because the rear hip is already rotated back, it has a full range of rotational motion available to drive the punch forward. Coaching cue: "Point your lead shoulder at the threat — not your chest, not your side, your shoulder." The body angle should feel natural and athletic, similar to a ready position in many sports.

## Weight Distribution

Weight distribution in the Krav Maga fighting stance is approximately 50/50 between the front and rear foot, with some instructors teaching a slight forward bias of 55/45 or 60/40. The even distribution enables rapid movement in all directions — forward to attack, backward to retreat, laterally to angle off. A slight forward bias loads the lead hand for faster jabs and facilitates aggressive forward pressure, which aligns with Krav Maga's philosophy of immediate counterattack. The weight should be carried on the balls of the feet, never flat-footed, ensuring constant readiness for explosive movement. The center of gravity sits low between the feet, roughly at hip level. Being flat-footed — with weight on the heels — dramatically slows reaction time and makes it nearly impossible to generate power from the ground up through the kinetic chain. Testing the weight distribution: a training partner should be able to push the fighter lightly from any direction, and the fighter should be able to absorb and redirect the force without stumbling. If the fighter falls forward easily, too much weight is forward; if backward, too much is on the rear foot. The 50/50 starting position is a neutral ready state from which the fighter can shift weight dynamically as needed for specific strikes or defensive movements.

## Rear Heel and Knee Position

The rear heel is raised approximately 2-5 centimeters off the ground, with weight balanced on the ball of the rear foot. This elevated heel position serves multiple functions: it pre-loads the calf and gastrocnemius muscles for explosive forward movement, facilitates the rear foot pivot necessary for cross punches, and keeps the fighter in a state of constant athletic readiness — similar to a sprinter in the starting blocks. The front heel remains on the ground for stability. Both knees are slightly bent at approximately 15-25 degrees of flexion — enough to lower the center of gravity and absorb impact, but not so deep as to limit mobility or fatigue the quadriceps prematurely. The slight knee bend acts as a natural shock absorber and allows for rapid level changes. Locked knees are never acceptable as they slow reaction time, compromise balance, transmit ground impact directly to the spine, and eliminate the ability to generate explosive upward force. Conversely, an excessively deep knee bend (beyond 30 degrees) wastes energy and limits the speed of lateral movement. Coaching cue: "Athletic ready position — imagine you're about to receive a pass in basketball. Light, bouncy, alive." The rear heel raise should be natural, not forced to the point where the fighter is on their tiptoes.

## Guard Position — Hand Placement

The guard is the default hand position maintained at all times when not actively striking. Both hands are held at cheekbone height with closed fists, thumbs wrapped on the outside of the fingers (never tucked inside the fist, which risks thumb fracture on impact). The lead hand is positioned approximately 15-20 centimeters in front of the face, acting as both a defensive barrier and a loaded weapon ready to fire. The rear hand is held tight against the cheekbone or jaw, approximately 5-8 centimeters from the face — close enough to block incoming strikes but positioned to launch immediately. The fists are held loosely when not striking to conserve energy and maintain hand speed — they tighten only at the moment of impact. Palms face slightly inward toward each other, with the wrists straight and aligned with the forearms. This positioning provides immediate protection for the face and jaw while keeping the hands ready to launch strikes along the shortest possible path to the target. The guard height at the cheekbones protects the most vulnerable targets: the temples, jaw hinge, and orbital bones. Dropping the hands even 10 centimeters — to chin level or chest level — opens a direct line of attack to these targets. Coaching cue: "Phone to your ear, phone to your ear" — each hand should be positioned as if holding a phone to the cheekbone. The guard must become the default resting position that the hands return to automatically after every action.

## Guard Position — Elbows, Chin, and Shoulders

The elbows are tucked tightly against the ribs and the sides of the torso, protecting the liver (right side) and spleen (left side) — both organs that can cause debilitating pain or unconsciousness when struck. This tight elbow position also ensures that punches travel along a straight line from guard to target, minimizing telegraphing and maximizing the speed of the punch. If the elbows float outward, punches must travel a curved, looping path that is slower and more visible to the opponent. The chin is tucked downward toward the chest — approximately 15-20 degrees below neutral head position — reducing exposure of the jaw and throat. The jaw is the primary knockout target because a strike to the jaw rotates the head, causing the brain to impact the inside of the skull. Tucking the chin makes the jaw harder to reach and braces the neck muscles to resist rotation. The shoulders are slightly raised — shrugged approximately 1-2 centimeters — to create additional protection for the jaw and the sides of the neck, where the carotid arteries are vulnerable. This micro-shrug also pre-loads the deltoid muscles for faster punch initiation. The overall guard creates a compact protective shell around the head and torso while maintaining full offensive readiness. Imi Lichtenfeld's founding principle of simultaneous defense and attack is embodied in this guard position: every element that protects also enables instant counterstrikes. Coaching cue: "Elbows to ribs, chin to chest, shoulders to ears — make yourself small and dangerous."
