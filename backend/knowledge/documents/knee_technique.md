# Krav Maga Knee Strike Technique

## Straight Knee Strike

The straight knee is the most fundamental and powerful knee strike in Krav Maga, driving the knee directly forward and upward into the opponent. The strike initiates from the fighting stance — the striking leg drives the knee straight forward and upward while the hips thrust aggressively toward the target. The critical power mechanism is the hip thrust: the hips drive forward into the strike, not just the knee rising. Without the hip thrust, the knee strike becomes a mere leg lift that carries only the mass of the lower leg (approximately 4-6 kg); with the hip thrust, the entire body mass (approximately 30-40 kg of effective mass) drives behind the strike. The hands play an equally important role — when within clinching range, the fighter grabs the opponent's head, shoulders, or collar with both hands and pulls the opponent downward into the rising knee. This creates a collision force that combines the upward drive of the knee with the downward pull on the opponent — effectively doubling the relative velocity at impact. The pull should be a sharp, explosive downward and slightly forward yank that breaks the opponent's posture and loads their weight onto the incoming knee. The primary targets for the straight knee are the groin (in self-defense scenarios), the solar plexus, the abdomen, and the face (when the opponent is bent over or being pulled downward). The hip thrust should drive the pelvis approximately 15-25 centimeters forward from its starting position, fully committing the body's mass into the strike. Coaching cue: "Drive your hips through them — the knee is the weapon but the hips are the engine. Grab their head and pull them down onto your knee like you're trying to make them and your knee meet in the middle."

## Round Knee Strike

The round knee drives diagonally into the target, striking with the inner part of the knee and the lower quadriceps area rather than the front of the kneecap. The trajectory follows a slightly circular path — the knee rises and simultaneously sweeps inward at approximately 30-45 degrees from the straight-ahead line, targeting the opponent's ribcage, outer thigh (common peroneal nerve area), or the side of the abdomen. The round knee requires a slight body turn — the torso rotates approximately 15-25 degrees toward the striking-knee side, and the standing leg pivots slightly (approximately 15-30 degrees) on the ball of the foot to facilitate the diagonal trajectory. The hip drives forward and inward simultaneously, combining the forward thrust of the straight knee with a lateral component. The round knee is particularly effective in clinch situations where the opponent is defending the centerline (protecting against straight knees) — the diagonal trajectory bypasses the opponent's arms and targets the vulnerable side of the torso. The striking surface for the round knee is the area approximately 5-10 centimeters above and around the kneecap, which is a broader and more forgiving contact zone than the straight knee's point-of-kneecap contact. The hands maintain clinch control or guard position, and the non-striking arm can actively push the opponent's body toward the incoming knee to increase collision force. At impact, the body weight shifts slightly toward the standing leg, which should be firmly planted with a slight knee bend for stability. Coaching cue: "Drive the knee diagonally across — think of your knee cutting through their ribcage at an angle. Turn your hip into it, pivot on the standing foot, and drive through."

## Clinch Knee Strikes

The clinch knee is delivered from the Thai clinch position (also called the double collar tie or plum position), where the fighter controls the opponent's head with both hands clasped behind the neck, elbows pressed against the opponent's collarbones and upper chest. From this position of control, the fighter delivers rapid, alternating knee strikes to the opponent's body and face. The clinch position provides maximum control over the opponent's posture — the fighter pulls the opponent's head downward and forward, breaking their balance and preventing them from striking back effectively. The knees alternate rapidly — left knee, right knee, left knee — with each knee driven by an aggressive hip thrust and a simultaneous downward pull on the opponent's head. The rhythm should be explosive and relentless, not allowing the opponent time to recover or establish a defensive position. Each individual knee in the clinch sequence may carry less power than a single committed straight knee (approximately 60-75% of maximum force) because the rapid alternation sacrifices some hip commitment for speed and volume. However, the cumulative effect of multiple rapid knee strikes to the body — particularly to the solar plexus, floating ribs, and liver — is devastating. The standing leg switches with each knee: as the right knee strikes, the left foot supports; as the left knee strikes, the right foot supports. The standing foot should remain on the ball of the foot with a slight knee bend, pivoting minimally to accommodate each knee. The fighter must resist the temptation to lean back during clinch knees — the torso stays upright or leans slightly forward, maintaining constant pressure on the opponent's posture through the clinch grip. Coaching cue: "Control the head, break their posture, then machine-gun the knees — one after another, hip thrust with each one, pull them into every strike."

## Hip Engagement and Power Mechanics

The hip thrust is the single most important mechanical element of all knee strikes — it is what separates a powerful, fight-ending knee from a weak, ineffective leg raise. The hip engagement follows a specific sequence: the knee begins to rise while simultaneously the hips drive aggressively forward and upward. The pelvis should feel as though it is trying to reach the target, not just the knee. The gluteal muscles and hip flexors work in concert — the gluteals extend the hip joint on the standing side to drive the body forward, while the hip flexors on the striking side lift the knee. The core muscles (rectus abdominis, obliques) contract forcefully to connect the upper body's pull on the opponent to the lower body's upward drive, creating a rigid torque-transfer pathway. For the straight knee, the hip thrust is directly forward — the pelvis advances approximately 15-25 centimeters. For the round knee, the hip drives forward and rotates approximately 15-25 degrees toward the striking side. For clinch knees, each hip thrust is shorter (approximately 8-15 centimeters) but rapid and continuous. The standing leg plays a critical supporting role: it maintains a slight bend (approximately 15-20 degrees at the knee), stays on the ball of the foot for mobility, and provides the stable base from which the hip can thrust forward. A straight, locked standing leg prevents proper hip drive; a standing leg that is too bent wastes the body's height and reduces upward force. The breath should be exhaled sharply with each knee strike — a short, explosive exhalation that engages the core and maximizes force transfer. Coaching cue: "Your hips go through the target — think of your belt buckle trying to touch them. The knee is just what arrives first."

## Balance and Stance Recovery

Maintaining balance during knee strikes is a critical skill that separates effective technique from wild, uncontrolled flailing. The primary balance error is leaning too far back during the knee strike — compensating for the forward hip thrust by tilting the torso rearward. This backward lean disconnects the kinetic chain (the upper body is moving backward while the knee is supposed to be driving forward), reduces strike force by approximately 30-40%, and makes the fighter vulnerable to being pushed or swept because their weight is poorly distributed. The correct alignment is: the torso stays upright or leans very slightly forward, the hips drive forward, and the standing leg supports the center of gravity within the base of support. The center of gravity should never extend beyond the standing foot — if it does, the fighter will lose balance. After each knee strike, the knee must be rechambered — pulled back to the body — and the foot returned to the ground in a fighting stance position. The rechamber is not optional; leaving the leg extended or forward after the strike creates vulnerability and prevents follow-up actions. The return to fighting stance should be immediate and controlled — the foot lands approximately in its original position, weight redistributes to the normal 50/50 balance, and the guard is re-established. For clinch knees, the rechamber between alternating knees is very rapid — each knee returns to a briefly grounded position before the opposite knee fires, maintaining a continuous base of support. Coaching cue: "Stay over your standing foot — don't lean back. Drive the hips forward, not the shoulders backward. After the knee, bring it back to stance immediately — the technique isn't complete until you're back in guard."

## Common Errors and Corrections

The most prevalent error is not driving the hips — simply lifting the knee upward without the aggressive forward hip thrust. This produces a weak, arm-distance strike that may make contact but lacks the body mass behind it to cause significant damage. The knee just floats upward rather than driving through the target. Correction: practice the hip thrust without the knee strike — stand in fighting stance and thrust the hips forward explosively, then add the knee. A partner can place a hand on the fighter's hip to feel for the forward drive. The second critical error is leaning too far back during the strike. The backward lean is a natural but counterproductive compensation for the forward hip drive. It disconnects the kinetic chain and shifts the center of gravity behind the standing foot. Correction: practice knees in front of a mirror, monitoring torso position; the chest should stay over or slightly ahead of the standing foot. The third error is losing balance — particularly common during clinch knees where the rapid alternation combined with the pulling force on the opponent's head can pull the fighter off-balance. Correction: practice clinch knees slowly at first, focusing on stable weight transfer from foot to foot, then gradually increase speed. The fourth error is not controlling the opponent's posture during clinch knees — pulling the opponent sideways rather than downward, or not pulling at all, which allows the opponent to posture up and defend or escape. Correction: the pull is straight down and slightly forward, breaking the opponent's posture and loading their weight onto the incoming knee. The fifth error is failing to rechamber — leaving the leg extended after the strike. Correction: every knee strike in training must end with the foot back on the ground in fighting stance before the next technique. Coaching cue: "Hips forward, torso upright, control the opponent, drive through, and get back to stance — every single time."

## Knee Strike Drills and Training Cues Summary

Key coaching cues for developing effective Krav Maga knee strikes: (1) "Hips through the target" — emphasizes the critical hip thrust that generates power. (2) "Pull them onto your knee" — emphasizes the combined pull-and-drive mechanics in clinch range. (3) "Stay over your base" — emphasizes maintaining balance over the standing foot. (4) "Rechamber every time" — emphasizes returning to fighting stance after each knee strike. (5) "Belt buckle to target" — emphasizes the forward hip drive using a concrete visual reference. Common training drills include: the Thai pad drill where the partner holds a pad at waist or lower chest height and the fighter drives straight and round knees with full hip commitment; the clinch-knee drill where two fighters work from clinch position with one throwing controlled alternating knees while the other practices absorbing and maintaining clinch position; the wall drill where the fighter stands approximately 40 centimeters from a wall and practices knee strikes without their back touching the wall (prevents the backward lean); the hip-thrust isolation drill where the fighter practices the hip thrust motion without the knee, focusing on driving the pelvis forward explosively while maintaining an upright torso; the combination drill integrating knees after punch combinations — for example, jab-cross-clinch entry-alternating knees — to practice the transition from punching range to clinch-knee range; and the balance drill where the fighter practices slow, controlled single-knee strikes while standing on one leg, building the standing-leg stability required for powerful knee strikes.
