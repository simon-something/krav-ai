# Common Striking Errors in Krav Maga

## Dropping the Non-Punching Hand

One of the most critical and frequently observed errors across all skill levels, from complete beginners to experienced practitioners under fatigue. When throwing a jab, the rear hand drops away from the cheekbone; when throwing a cross, the lead hand drops. This exposes the jaw and the entire side of the face to counter-strikes — and the jaw is the primary knockout target because a clean strike to the jaw rotates the head, causing concussion. The non-punching hand should remain pressed against the cheekbone at all times during a strike, maintaining full guard duty while the other hand attacks. The drop often occurs unconsciously as a "sympathetic movement" — the body naturally wants both arms to participate in the punching motion, so as one hand extends, the other drifts downward or forward in mirror response. At beginner level, the drop can be 15-30 centimeters (hand falling to chin or chest level); even advanced practitioners commonly drop 5-10 centimeters under fatigue, stress, or when focused on power. Correction drills: practice with a training partner who holds a focus pad next to the fighter's face on the guard side and delivers a light tap any time the hand drops away — this creates immediate negative feedback. Mirror work with exclusive focus on the non-punching hand (ignore the punching hand entirely and watch only the guard hand). Tennis ball drill: place a tennis ball between the guard hand and the cheekbone, and it must stay trapped there during every strike repetition. Coaching cue: "Your guard hand is superglued to your face — it doesn't know the other hand exists."

## Telegraphing — Pre-Strike Loading

Telegraphing is any visible preparatory movement that precedes a strike and signals intent to the opponent, giving them time to defend, evade, or counter. The most common telegraphing errors are: (1) Pulling the fist back before punching forward — sometimes called "cocking" or "chambering," where the hand retracts 5-15 centimeters from guard position before moving forward toward the target. This doubles the visible preparation time and creates an obvious signal. (2) Shifting weight to the rear foot before driving forward for the cross — this creates a visible backward rocking motion or sway that any trained opponent will recognize instantly. (3) Dipping or loading the shoulder on the punching side before the strike — the shoulder drops 2-5 centimeters before rising into the punch. (4) Widening the eyes, tensing the facial muscles, or changing facial expression before attacking — these are involuntary micro-expressions that telegraph intent. (5) Taking a deep preparatory breath or gasping before striking. (6) Wiggling, opening, or re-clenching the fingers of the punching hand before forming a tight fist. The root cause of telegraphing is almost always muscular tension — a tense fighter cannot initiate movement smoothly from a relaxed state, so their body creates momentum through visible preparatory movements like a spring being compressed before release. Correction: practice deep relaxation of the shoulders, neck, and arms between strikes. Initiate punches from complete stillness. Have training partners immediately call out or counter every telegraph they observe. Video review is extremely effective for identifying telegraphs the fighter cannot feel. Coaching cue: "Punch from where your hand is. No preview, no announcement, no loading. Relax and fire."

## Chicken-Winging the Elbow

Chicken-winging occurs when the elbow flares outward to the side during a punch instead of staying tucked against the body and driving straight forward behind the fist. This creates a visible "wing" shape with the arm that has multiple negative consequences. On the jab, the lead elbow lifts laterally as the punch extends, creating a wide profile that the opponent can easily read and time a counter against. On the cross, the rear elbow swings outward in an arc before the punch path straightens, adding distance and telegraphing the strike. The flared elbow also opens a gap between the arm and the torso, creating a vulnerable channel for body shots to the ribs and liver. Biomechanically, chicken-winging reduces punch speed because the fist must travel a longer, curved path instead of the shortest straight line to the target. It also reduces power because energy is wasted on lateral movement that does not contribute to forward force. Common causes of chicken-winging include: trying to generate power through the arm alone (muscling the punch rather than using hip rotation), poor shoulder mobility, or incorrect mental model of the punching motion (thinking of a hook motion instead of a straight punch). Correction drills: wall drill — stand sideways to a wall with the punching arm's elbow approximately 2 centimeters from the wall surface, then throw straight punches without the elbow touching the wall. Resistance band drill: wrap a light resistance band around the torso and keep the elbows inside the band during all shadowboxing. Partner check: training partner places their hand lightly against the elbow during slow-speed punching drills and provides feedback when the elbow pushes outward. Coaching cue: "Elbows on rails — they only travel forward and back on a straight track, never side to side. If your elbow goes out, your punch goes wide."

## Leaning Forward and Overcommitting

Overcommitting occurs when the fighter leans the upper body forward past the front foot during a punch, projecting the center of gravity beyond the base of support. This is especially common on the cross, where the desire for extra power or reach causes excessive forward lean. Observable signs of overcommitting: the head extends beyond a vertical line above the front knee, the rear foot lifts completely off the ground (loss of grounding), the fighter stumbles or takes an involuntary step forward after the punch, or the fighter cannot retract the punch quickly because their weight is committed forward. Overcommitting is dangerous for multiple reasons: recovery to guard is impossible because the body must first re-center its balance; the fighter cannot defend against counter-strikes because they are off-balance and structurally compromised; they are vulnerable to being pulled forward (an opponent can grab the extended arm or head and yank them into a clinch, takedown, or knee strike); and in a self-defense context, falling into or past an opponent eliminates all tactical advantage. The root cause is usually a desire for more range or more power, but ironically overcommitting reduces both — the structural chain breaks when the body over-extends, and the punch loses the grounded force that proper mechanics provide. Correction: place a target at correct range (where the punch lands at full extension without leaning) and practice hitting it without the head crossing the front knee line. Partner stability drill: training partner pushes lightly on the fighter's shoulder at the moment of impact — if the fighter stumbles forward, they are overcommitting. Coaching cue: "Stay behind your punch — your fist goes to them, your body stays home. If I push you at the moment you punch, you should not fall."

## Crossing Feet and Stance Collapse

Feet crossing occurs when the fighter's feet pass each other during movement or striking, momentarily placing one foot directly in front of the other on a single line. This creates a narrow, unstable base that can be toppled by any lateral force — even a light push. Stance collapse refers more broadly to any loss of proper stance geometry — feet drifting too close together (loss of lateral stability), the rear foot stepping forward to nearly match the front foot (loss of stagger depth), or the front foot stepping backward (telegraphing retreat). These errors most commonly occur during combination punching when the fighter's attention is consumed by the hands and the feet are neglected. During a jab-cross combination, the enthusiasm to close distance can cause the rear foot to step forward past the front foot. During retreat, the front foot may step back past the rear foot. In both cases, the fighter is momentarily standing on a "tightrope" with zero lateral stability. The fighting stance must maintain its approximate width (shoulder-width lateral spread) and depth (one shoulder-width front-to-back stagger) throughout all striking and movement. Correction: line drill — place tape on the floor as the "center line" and practice all footwork and striking while ensuring the feet always remain on opposite sides of the line. Agility ladder work that reinforces maintaining stance width during forward and lateral movement. Partner resistance drill: training partner periodically pushes the fighter laterally during pad work to test stance stability. Coaching cue: "Railroad tracks — your feet are always on two separate tracks. They never step on the same track."

## Winding Up Before Punches

Winding up is a dramatic and highly visible form of telegraphing where the fighter makes a large, circular, or exaggerated preparatory movement before striking. Common wind-ups include: pulling the fist back to the hip or waist before punching forward (reminiscent of a traditional martial arts chamber but completely counterproductive in a live self-defense context), swinging the elbow backward in a wide arc before driving the cross forward, rotating the torso away from the target before rotating explosively into the punch (like winding up a spring), dropping the hand to waist level before throwing an uppercut-trajectory strike to the head, or taking a large step backward to "build momentum" before charging forward with a punch. Wind-ups are dramatic and give opponents significant time — often 200-500 milliseconds — to see the incoming strike, raise their guard, evade, or throw a counter-strike before the wound-up punch even arrives. They also waste energy on non-productive movement and increase the total distance the fist must travel, reducing effective speed. In Krav Maga, which emphasizes efficiency, directness, and the shortest path to the target, wind-ups contradict every core principle. The punch must travel from the guard position directly to the target with zero intermediate detour. Correction: start every punch from a dead stop in guard position — no momentum, no preparation. Slow-motion mirror work to identify and consciously eliminate any backward, circular, or downward motion before the forward punch path. Partner accountability: partner holds a pad and pulls it away whenever they see any wind-up motion — the striker only gets to hit the pad when the punch comes clean from guard.

## Insufficient Hip Rotation

Failure to rotate the hips properly is the single biggest power deficit in striking technique and is epidemic among beginners and intermediates. On the cross, insufficient hip rotation means the punch is thrown with arm strength alone — reducing impact force by 50% or more compared to a properly rotated cross, because the effective mass drops from approximately 30 kg (full-body cross) to approximately 3-5 kg (arm-only punch). On the jab, lack of even the subtle hip engagement results in a weak, pushing punch with no snap. Observable signs of insufficient hip rotation: the torso remains bladed throughout the cross (the shoulders never turn toward square with the target), the rear foot does not pivot (the heel stays pointing backward instead of rotating outward), the hips remain facing sideways throughout the punch, and there is no visible difference in body position between the guard stance and the punching stance. The fighter appears to be "arm punching" — the arms extend and retract while the body remains static. Root causes include: weak core muscles that cannot generate or transmit rotational force, poor body awareness (not understanding that the hips should be involved), fear of opening the body to the opponent, or simply not being taught the hip rotation mechanic. Correction: hip isolation drills without using the hands at all (rotate the hips explosively while keeping hands on the hips, focusing on the foot pivot and hip drive), heavy bag work where the only objective is to make the bag swing through hip rotation, and slow-motion cross repetitions where the coach calls out the sequence: "push-turn-punch" to reinforce the proximal-to-distal ordering. Coaching cue: "Hips first, hands second — your body throws the punch, your arm just delivers it to the address."

## Punching With a Loose or Misaligned Fist

Fist integrity at the moment of impact is essential for both striking effectiveness and injury prevention. Without a properly formed, tightly clenched, and correctly aligned fist, the force generated by the entire kinetic chain is wasted or, worse, injures the striker's own hand. Common fist errors include: (1) Loose fist — fingers not fully clenched at the moment of impact, which causes the hand to absorb and dissipate force internally rather than transferring it to the target. A loose fist also risks finger jams, sprains, and dislocations. (2) Thumb tucked inside the fingers — this is a near-guarantee of a broken thumb on impact, as the thumb is trapped between the clenched fingers and the target with no escape route for the force. The thumb must always wrap across the outside of the index and middle fingers. (3) Bent wrist — the most common fist-related injury mechanism. A wrist that is flexed (bent downward), extended (bent upward), or deviated laterally at impact directs force into the small bones and ligaments of the wrist joint instead of transmitting it through the structural column of the forearm bones. This causes sprains, fractures, and chronic wrist pain. (4) Wrong knuckle contact — striking with the ring and pinky finger knuckles (the 4th and 5th metacarpals, which are thinner and less structurally supported) instead of the index and middle finger knuckles (which align with the strong radius bone of the forearm). Striking with the wrong knuckles is the primary cause of "boxer's fracture." (5) Hyperextended wrist — wrist bent backward on impact, which collapses the structural chain. Correction: wrist push-ups to build strength and awareness, heavy bag work at slow speed with conscious attention to fist formation at contact, and hand wrapping during all impact training to reinforce wrist alignment. Coaching cue: "Tight fist, straight wrist, first two knuckles. Lock it at impact — loose on the way there, tight on arrival."

## Failure to Return to Guard

Not returning to guard after a strike is a compounding error — every subsequent action from a non-guard position is compromised defensively and offensively. After throwing a punch, the striking hand must snap back to the cheekbone guard position immediately. Common return-to-guard failures include: (1) Leaving the punching hand extended at full reach — a "frozen arm" that stays out for 200-500 milliseconds after impact, during which the fighter has zero guard on the punching side and the extended arm can be grabbed. (2) Retracting the hand but only to chin or chest level instead of all the way back to cheekbone level — this partial return creates a false sense of security while still leaving the face exposed above the hand position. (3) Retracting slowly ("lazy retraction") — the hand drifts back to guard over 300-500 milliseconds instead of snapping back in under 100 milliseconds. (4) Dropping the hand below the guard line on the return path — the hand goes from full extension down to the waist and then up to the cheekbone, following a U-shaped path instead of the direct straight-line return. Each of these failures leaves the fighter exposed to counter-strikes for an extended duration. In a self-defense situation, failure to return to guard after a strike commonly results in being hit by the very next attack — even if the initial offensive strike was successful. The opponent does not wait for the fighter to reset; they counter immediately. Correction: every striking drill should include a deliberate return-to-guard element, with verbal cues ("fire and home, fire and home"). Partner counter drill: pad holder throws a light counter-swing after every punch — if the striker's guard is not back in position, they receive a light tap as feedback. Speed return drill: throw a single punch and time how fast the hand returns to cheekbone contact using video analysis. Coaching cue: "The punch is not finished until your hand is back on your face — a punch without a return is only half a technique."
