# Krav Maga Elbow Strike Technique

## Overview and Range Classification

Elbow strikes are a defining feature of the Krav Maga striking system — they are among the most devastating close-range weapons available and are heavily emphasized in Krav Maga training at all levels. Elbows are effective at extremely close range — approximately 15-30 centimeters from the opponent — where punches cannot generate meaningful force because there is insufficient distance for arm extension. The elbow occupies the range gap between punches and clinch-work, making it the go-to strike when an attacker is in the fighter's face, during clinch struggles, after closing distance aggressively, or when grabbed. The striking surface for all elbow strikes is the tip of the elbow — the olecranon process — which is one of the hardest and most durable bones in the body. Unlike punching, where the small bones of the hand are at risk of fracture (especially without gloves), the elbow can deliver devastating force repeatedly without injury to the striker. This makes elbow strikes ideal for Krav Maga's self-defense context where hand wraps and gloves are unavailable. The olecranon concentrates the entire force of the strike into a small, hard point approximately 2-3 square centimeters in area, generating extreme pressure at the point of impact. A common error is striking with the forearm rather than the elbow tip, which disperses force over a larger surface area and dramatically reduces the strike's effectiveness. Coaching cue: "The tip of your elbow is a weapon — it's harder than your fist and it doesn't break. Use the point, not the flat of your arm."

## Horizontal Elbow Strike

The horizontal elbow is the most common and versatile elbow strike in Krav Maga, mechanically similar to a hook punch but at much closer range. The arm folds tightly so that the fist touches or nearly touches the same-side shoulder (or the fist is clenched near the chest), creating a compact striking unit. The elbow drives through the target on a horizontal plane at chin or temple height, powered by full hip rotation identical to the hook punch — the lead foot pivots on the ball of the foot, the hip rotates approximately 45-60 degrees, and the torso follows as a connected unit. The elbow travels through a short, tight arc of approximately 90-120 degrees. The feeling should be of the entire body rotating to drive the elbow through the target, not of the arm swinging independently. The non-striking hand remains in guard position — pressed against the opposite cheekbone — or grabs the opponent's head or clothing to control distance and pull them into the strike. At impact, the elbow tip contacts the target (typically the jaw, temple, or orbital bone), and the body's rotation drives through the target by approximately 5-10 centimeters. The horizontal elbow can be thrown from either side — the lead horizontal elbow is faster but carries less rotational force; the rear horizontal elbow generates more power due to the greater rotation arc. The weight shifts forward during the strike, moving from 50/50 to approximately 60/40 on the lead foot. Coaching cue: "Fold your arm tight, then rotate your entire body — the elbow is a battering ram and your hips are the engine driving it."

## Vertical (Upward Rising) Elbow Strike

The vertical elbow is a rising strike that drives the elbow tip upward into the opponent's chin or the underside of the jaw — the same target zone as the uppercut but with a harder, more durable striking surface. The arm folds tightly with the fist near the same-side shoulder. The strike initiates from below, with the elbow driving vertically upward powered by explosive leg extension. The knees dip approximately 10-15 degrees, then the legs extend explosively, propelling the hips upward and forward. The hip thrusts slightly forward (approximately 15-20 degrees of rotation), and the shoulder drives the folded arm upward in a rising arc. The elbow tip makes contact at the apex of the upward drive, striking the underside of the chin at approximately 80-85 degrees from horizontal. The feeling is of the entire body rising explosively to drive the elbow point through the target from below. The vertical elbow is particularly effective against an opponent who is bending forward — for example, after taking a body shot — because the rising trajectory meets the descending head. It is also highly effective in clinch situations where the fighter can control the opponent's head with the non-striking hand and pull it downward into the rising elbow. At impact, the entire body should be extending upward, with the legs straightened, the hips thrust forward, and the shoulder driving the elbow tip through the chin. Coaching cue: "Explode up from your legs — drive that elbow point through their chin like a rocket launch. Your whole body goes up into the strike."

## Diagonal Elbow Strike

The diagonal elbow follows a 45-degree downward arc, combining elements of the horizontal elbow's rotational power with a downward driving force. The arm folds tightly, and the elbow drives diagonally across and downward, typically targeting the temple, the junction of the jaw and ear, or the side of the neck. The strike is initiated by a slight upward lift of the elbow (raising it approximately 10-15 centimeters above the target height), followed by an explosive downward-diagonal drive powered by hip rotation and the engagement of the latissimus dorsi and core muscles pulling the elbow through the arc. The diagonal trajectory generates a combined rotational and downward force that is particularly effective at causing disorientation and structural damage. The hip rotation for the diagonal elbow is approximately 30-45 degrees — less than the full horizontal elbow because the downward component contributes additional force that compensates for the reduced rotation. The diagonal elbow can also be thrown in the opposite direction — rising diagonally from low to high at a 45-degree upward angle — targeting the chin or jaw from below and to the side. The downward diagonal variant is more commonly used in self-defense scenarios where the fighter has a height advantage or when the opponent is beginning to duck or lower their head. The non-striking hand should either maintain guard position or actively control the opponent by gripping the head, shoulder, or clothing. Coaching cue: "Raise it up, then slash it down at 45 degrees — imagine cutting diagonally through the target from high to low. Your hips and your lats drive the strike together."

## Backward Elbow Strike

The backward elbow is designed for situations where an attacker is directly behind the fighter — a common Krav Maga self-defense scenario such as being grabbed from behind, bear-hugged, or approached from the rear. The technique begins with the fighter turning their head to look over the shoulder on the striking side, identifying the target (typically the attacker's solar plexus, ribs, or face depending on relative height). This head turn is critical for accuracy — striking blindly reduces effectiveness and may miss entirely. The striking arm's elbow drives straight back along a horizontal plane, powered by a sharp rearward thrust of the shoulder and contraction of the rear deltoid, rhomboids, and triceps. The fist of the striking arm may be clenched against the chest to ensure the arm is folded tightly, maximizing the elbow's rearward extension. The hips rotate toward the striking side approximately 15-25 degrees to add body mass behind the rearward drive. The non-striking hand maintains guard position in front of the face or actively begins to turn the body to face the attacker — the backward elbow is often used as the first strike in a sequence that continues as the fighter turns fully toward the threat. The backward elbow does not generate as much force as the horizontal elbow (it lacks the full hip rotation) but compensates with the element of surprise and its accessibility from a disadvantaged position. Coaching cue: "Look over your shoulder, find the target, then drive your elbow straight back like a piston — shoulder, elbow, point, through the target. Then turn and face them."

## Common Errors and Corrections

The most prevalent error across all elbow strikes is striking with the forearm rather than the elbow tip. This distributes the force over a much larger surface area (the flat of the forearm is approximately 30-40 square centimeters versus the elbow tip's 2-3 square centimeters), drastically reducing impact pressure and effectiveness. Correction: practice elbow strikes on a heavy bag with focus on feeling the point of the elbow making contact; the sensation of the olecranon striking the bag is distinctly different from the flat forearm. The second critical error is flaring the arm too wide — not folding the arm tightly enough, which opens the elbow angle and reduces the striking effectiveness while also creating unnecessary exposure. The fist should be close to the same-side shoulder or chest, keeping the arm as compact as possible. Correction: practice folding the arm fully before every elbow strike until the tight fold becomes automatic. The third error is failing to rotate the hips, resulting in an arm-only strike that carries only the mass of the arm. Without hip rotation, the elbow strike loses approximately 40-50% of its potential force. Correction: practice the hip rotation and foot pivot in isolation, then add the elbow movement. The fourth error specific to the backward elbow is failing to look before striking — swinging blindly behind without identifying the target. This results in missed strikes and wasted energy. Correction: always turn the head and visually acquire the target before the elbow fires. Coaching cue: "Point of the elbow, tight fold, full hip rotation, eyes on target — get all four right and the elbow is the most dangerous weapon you have."

## Elbow Drills and Training Cues Summary

Key coaching cues for developing effective Krav Maga elbow strikes: (1) "Fold tight, strike with the point" — emphasizes the compact arm position and correct striking surface. (2) "Hips drive the elbow" — emphasizes rotational power from the lower body rather than arm movement. (3) "Close the distance, unleash elbows" — emphasizes that elbows belong at extremely close range. (4) "Eyes before elbows" — emphasizes looking at the target (especially for backward elbows) before striking. (5) "Through the target, not at it" — emphasizes penetration and follow-through. Common training drills include: the pad drill where the partner holds a Thai pad at close range and the fighter drives through horizontal, vertical, and diagonal elbows in sequence; the heavy bag drill focusing on feeling the olecranon make contact rather than the forearm — training the correct point of contact; the clinch-range drill where two fighters work at clinch distance and one throws controlled elbows while the other practices covering and defending; the backward elbow drill where a partner stands behind the fighter, taps their shoulder, and the fighter executes the look-and-strike sequence; and the combination drill integrating elbows after punch combinations (jab-cross-lead elbow, or jab-cross-hook-rear elbow) to practice transitioning from punching range to elbow range as the distance closes.
